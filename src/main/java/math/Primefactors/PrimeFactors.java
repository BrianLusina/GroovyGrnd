     * 1. Takes care of composite numbers, such as 2, such that if number is divisible by 2, add it to list, then divide by 2
     * <p>
     * 2. Also, takes care of composite numbers, 3, taking care of odd numbers, for loop starts at 3 and increments by 3 upto square root of input, all remaining prime factors must be odd (difference of two prime factors must be at least 2), this explains why i is incremented by 2.
     * we run a loop and do following in loop
     * a) Find the least prime factor x (must be less than âˆšinput,)
     * b) Remove all occurrences x from input by repeatedly dividing n by x.
     * c) Repeat steps a and b for divided input and x+=2. The steps a and b are repeated till input becomes either 1 or a prime number.
     * <p>
     * 3. checks to see if input is a prime number greater than two, if so, add to the list
     *
     * @param input, number to evaluate to obtain prime factors
