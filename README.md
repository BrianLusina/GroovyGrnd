Java PlayGround has a series of small programs and snippets purely made in Java
Groovy (because Groovy) and Kotlin. Reason for naming it so is because of how these three languages interact
with each other.

The project is divided into 3 modules, each moduel targets a specific language.

To run the tests:

```sh
$ gradle test
```
