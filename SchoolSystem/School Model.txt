you have been contracted by the principal of sch X to create their sch information management sys. 

the sys. is supposed to store students details as their admission number, their name, their current class and their pending school fees balance and their current class

in the system, a student can register fot units, opt out of units, pay school fees and check their pending sch fees balance. YOur taks as the developer to model this scenario by:

1.identifying possible classes in the above system
2.identify the data members and their access scope
3.define the getters and setters for the data members
4.identify the methods for the classes and return their types and parameters

//identify the class
public class SchInfoSys{


	/*
	declare the properties of the class

	their admission number,
	their name,
	their current class and their pending school fees balance
	*/

	//data members and their access scope is private
	private int admissionNo;
	private String name;
	private String currentClass;
	private double feeBalance;

	//constructor
	public SchInfoSys(int a,String n,String c,double f){
		admissionNo = a;
		name = n;
		currentClass = c;
		feeBalance = f;
		}

		//default constructor
		public SchInfoSys(){
			this(0,"Name","Current Class",0.0);
			}

	//defining the getters and setters

	//getter and setter for admission number data member in class
	public void setAdmissionNo(int admissionNo)
	{
		this.admissionNo = admissionNo;
	}

			public int getAdmissionNo()
			{
				return admissionNo;
			}

	//define getter and setter for name data member in class
	public void setName(String name)
		{
			this.name = name;
		}

				public String getName()
				{
					return name;
				}

	//getter and setter for current class data member in class
	public void setCurrentClass(String currentClass)
		{
			this.currentClass = currentClass;
		}

				public String getCurrentClass()
				{
					return currentClass;
				}

	//getter and setter for data member fee balance in class
	public void setFeeBalance(double feeBalance)
		{
			this.feeBalance = feeBalance;
		}

				public double getFeeBalance()
				{
					return feeBalance;
				}

	/*
	//identify the behaviour of the class

	a student can register for units,
	opt out of units,
	pay school fees and
	check their pending sch fees balance
	*/

	public boolean unitRegister(boolean fees){
		return fees;
		}

	public String optOut(String unit){
		return unit;
		}

	public double deposit(double schFees){
		return schFees;
		}

	public void displayFeeBalance(){

		}




	public static void main(String[] args){

		}
	}
