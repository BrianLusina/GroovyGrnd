 * Description:
   We are given 3 strings: str1, str2, and str3.
   Str3 is said to be a shuffle of str1 and str2 if it can be formed by interleaving the characters of str1 and str2
   in a way that maintains the left to right ordering of the characters from each string.
   For example, given str1="abc" and str2="def", str3="dabecf" is a valid shuffle since it preserves the character
    ordering of the two strings.
    So, given these 3 strings write a function that detects whether str3 is a valid shuffle of str1 and str2.
